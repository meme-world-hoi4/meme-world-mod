 PAR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "The first Partizans settlements were formed into a single state just last century. The accompanying failure in the initial development and actual destruction brought the Partisan nation to the brink. But despite this, Partizania, which is a relatively young state, managed to pass through a series of difficulties. The people who began to build a state with a "clean slate", overcoming the hard edges of life Partizania, truly seems powerful.\n Once unremarkable territorial entity has been both active domestic and foreign military and political activity, entering into alliances and conflicts with countries, significantly modernising the economy. But what will be the future path of the Partizan nation only fate itself knows..."
 JJK_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "Travelling in search of a land rich in natural resources, Kekan traders sailed to an unknown continent where they encountered tribes of an unknown people. Building their cities on the lands of the marvellous continent, they took the tribes under their rule. Lightning fast, the peoples borrowed elements of Kekan culture, and soon they overthrew the Kekan rulers and declared their own state. Having established a powerful alliance of Righteous and Supreme Unification under their leadership, the Jojonians were able to dictate their terms to other nations.\nBut the problems of being a superpower suddenly fell on the head of its people. It is up to Araki V to solve the nation's problems so that it does not fall to the onslaught of its enemies."

Epicana is getting closer every day to a castling in power."
 KIR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "About a century ago, a Jojonian prince conceived the idea of developing new distant lands for his state. For this purpose, by princely decree, the Jojonian Cossacks from the city of Kirovsk were gathered. Finally, having reached the lands of the unknown continent, the Cossacks immediately began to settle on them, and built their settlements on the free lands. And these lands were called Jojoninskaya Okraina, but the Cossacks themselves nicknamed these lands Kirovsk. For faithful service the prince rewarded the Cossacks with lands. Nowadays Jokolai the Second rules the Kirovsk lands, but for a century people have forgotten the good-natured prince who gave the statehood. The people want independent government. The Emperor, one way or another, will have to think about how to prevent the chaos..."
