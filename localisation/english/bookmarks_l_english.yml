 PAR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "The first settlements of the partizans were formed into a unified state just in the last century. The concomitant failure at the initial stage of development and actual annihilation brought the Partizan people to the brink. But despite this, Partizania, which is a relatively young state, managed to pass through a series of difficulties. The people who began to build a state from scratch, having overcome the hard times of Partizania, truly seems powerful.\nThe once unremarkable territorial entity was both active internal military-political and foreign military-political activities, entering into alliances and conflicts with countries, modernising the economy at a significant pace. But only fate itself knows what the future path of the Partizania people will be....
 JJK_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "Travelling in search of a land rich in natural resources, the Kekan traders sailed to an unknown continent where they encountered tribes of an unfamiliar people. Building their cities on the lands of the marvellous continent, they took the tribes under their rule. Lightning fast, the peoples borrowed elements of Kekan culture, and soon they overthrew the Kekan rulers and declared their own state. \nHaving established a powerful alliance of the Righteous and Supreme Unification under their leadership, the Jojonians were able to dictate their terms to other nations.\nBut the problems of being a superpower suddenly fell on the heads of its people. Araki V will have to solve the problems of the state so that it does not fall under the onslaught of its enemies.
 EPI_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "After several years of sovereignty and economic recovery, political instability and rampant reactionary forces, the Epican State is returning to a peaceful life. Despite this, the old Emperor, who came to power in a military coup earlier in the year, is becoming more and more unable to fulfil his duties with each passing day, and the nationalist and democratic lobbies are demanding to launch a campaign against the proclaimed states in the original Epican territories. Epicana is getting closer every day to a castling in power."
 KIR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "About a century ago, a Jojonian prince thought of developing new distant lands for his state. For this purpose, by princely decree, the Jojonian Cossacks from the city of Kirovsk were gathered. Finally, having reached the lands of the unknown continent, the Cossacks immediately began to settle on them, and built their settlements on the free lands. And these lands were called Jojoninskaya Okraina, but the Cossacks themselves nicknamed these lands Kirovsk. And the Cossacks fought for these lands. For faithful service the prince rewarded the Cossacks with lands, under the condition of loyalty to the princely power. So the Kirov state was formed. Nowadays Jokolai the Second rules Kirovsk lands, but for a century people have forgotten the good-natured prince who gave statehood. The people want independent government. The emperor, one way or another, will have to think about how to prevent the chaos reigning in the people...."
