 opolchenie.3.t: "The Emperor's Speech."
 opolchenie.3.d: "Due to the tense situation in the Democratic Opolchenie Republic, Emperor Kekron made a special speech in Kekingrad to address the people and journalists. \n\nIn addressing the crowd and beginning his speech, the Emperor told reporters that he was extremely unhappy with the deadly protests in Kekziland. According to His Majesty, he has reason to believe that the current government is secretly fuelling tensions among the people, which in turn favours their Gardernian masters, as they do not want to see the Opolchenie united. \n\nThere have also been statements that the Emperor will soon issue a decree to bring troops into the Autonomous Republic to restore order, as well as to help the GCOS organisation, which is fighting Gardernian influence in the country. The Emperor has very high hopes that the conflict will end peacefully and the Opolchenie people will reunite again in spite of the enemy."
 opolchenie.3.a: "Should the Emperor make such decisions?"
 news.2.t: "DRO declares independence."
 news.2.d: "Disturbing news comes from the Opolchenie: Emperor Kekron I has decreed the introduction of a Opolchenie regular army into the Autonomous Opolchenie Republic to restore order. In Kekziland, this news is seen as a takeover of the Republic, and therefore a violation of the agreements made after the civil war. Correspondents report the deployment of military forces in Kekziland, and the ARO authorities report the country's declaration of independence. At this point, the first skirmishes are reported on the border of the now independent Republic. News comes from Kekan City that Kekland is supporting the DRO in its conflict with the Opolchenie and is sending its forces to overthrow the government. World experts believe that the Opolchenie Emperor has decided to expand the borders of his state at the expense of the DRO."

 opolchenie.4.t: "Nationalist rallies".
 opolchenie.4.d: "On this day again, radicalised crowds of people took to the streets of Kekingrad. Throughout the march, the radicals chanted roughly the same thing: "Down with the DPR!". \nTowards evening, the march turned destructive: a mass brawl took place in the main square of the city. According to preliminary data, the most affected were supporters of the independence of the DRO, who decided to come out and express their disagreement with the opinion of the aggressive crowd, for which they were legitimately beaten by the radicals. The DRO embassy demands immediate clarification of the event."
 opolchenie.4.a: "Such marches will not end well for our country..."
 arepublicopolchenia.3.t: "Nationalist rallies".
 arepublicopolchenia.3.d: "Citizens dissatisfied with the events in Kekingrad began to take to the streets of cities. The inhabitants of Kekziland were particularly active. Gathering in front of the square, the discontented moved towards the government building. The crowd, fuelled by nationalists, reached the Government of the Republic building and began chanting slogans about expelling Opolchenie officials from the country. Meanwhile, on the outskirts of the city, Republican nationalists began to riot. \nA couple of hours later, it became known that the nationalists pogromed the house of one of the Opolchenie officials. The crowd trampled him to death right outside his residence. After this news, the crowds of protesters began to row. Night fell, but the whole country knew that the people of the Democratic Republic of the Opolchenie would not be fed up with the death of one official alone..."
 arepublicopolchenia.3.a: "How destructive is the anger of the Kekan.
 arepublicopolchenia.2.t: "Opolchenie people beat up Kekziland tourists"
 arepublicopolchenia.2.d: "Today, terrible news came from the Opolchenie capital: Opolchenie nationalists held processions all over the city with slogans of expelling our party and embassy representatives from the country. In addition, the procession took a destructive character throughout Kekingrad: nationalists descended on tourists from our Republic. According to unofficial reports, about a hundred Kekans who identified themselves as residents of the Democratic Republic were injured. Also, about 20 Kekans from the Republic were trampled or died in hospital as a result of the massacre. Our embassy fears that they may be the next target of the Opolchenie radicals."
 arepublicopolchenia.2.a: "Is the Opolchenie government going to take action at all?"
 arepublicopolchenia.1.t: "Emperor Kekron's decree."
 arepublicopolchenia.1.d: "From the crevices of all media broadcasts: the Opolchenie Emperor in Kekingrad has issued a Decree to bring troops into the Autonomous Opolchenie Republic, which means the Opolchenies have decided to annex us. According to intelligence reports, the Opolchenie army has accepted the Emperor's decree and has begun moving towards our border. \n\nIt seems that the Emperor of the Opolchenie has dared to break the agreements made after the Opolchenie civil war. If the Emperor allows himself to break the agreements, then who will stop us from declaring independence and opposing His Majesty's decree?"
 arepublicopolchenia.1.a: "Deploy military forces immediately!"
 keklandia.1.a: "The Opolchenie Emperor is making a big mistake..."
 keklandia.1.d: "From the cracks of all media broadcasts: the Opolchenie Emperor in Kekingrad has issued a decree to bring troops into the Autonomous Opolchenie Republic. According to intelligence reports, the Opolchenie army has accepted the Emperor's decree and has begun moving towards the border of the Autonomous Opolchenie Republic. \n\nThe Green House has had a mixed reaction to the conflict: the ministers have long had a grudge against the Opolchenie for their aggressive policies. In addition, there are credible reports that the Opolchenie has temporarily disbanded the Kekan Union Commission, which could indirectly be considered a violation of the terms of the Kekan Union, which means that we have the right to send troops into the Opolchenie. Moreover, the Opolchenie's Minister of Defence secretly arrested Otto Kerk, the founder of New Kekekia, who has been given the position of Chancellor in their country. \n\nOur main ally in the form of Gardernia agrees to help resolve the conflict, so we can take the risk of supporting the independence of a potentially new ally."
 keklandia.1.t: "Emperor Kekron's speech."
 opolchenie.2.t: "The Arrest of Otto Kirk."
 opolchenie.2.d: "Deep into the night, Opolchenie Chancellor Otto Kerk was in his country residence, pondering the Emperor's speech. He was outraged that the Emperor was allowing himself to decide matters of such magnitude independently of Parliament and the Chancellor. Besides, he was occupied with other very important thoughts: he was trying to work out what he should do in this critical situation. What is the right thing to do? \n\nAt that time, a black car pulled up in front of the residence. Out of it stepped a Kekan with the recognisable cap of the Minister of Defence of the Opolchenie. Without knocking on the door, the minister and a couple of uniformed kekans went inside. Finally, the stranger with the cap introduced himself as Opolchenie Defence Minister Edward Kekinescu. \n\n-"Mr Chancellor, you are accused of espionage. According to the criminal code, I am obliged to arrest you and detain you until the official decision of the court." \n\nThe men in police uniforms approached Otto Kerk. Soon they escorted him to a car and took him away to an unknown destination. Only the minister did not go with Otto Kerk. He stayed in the residence, where he waited for the arrival of the Emperor himself..."
 opolchenie.2.a: "Future traitors belong in prison."
 opolchenie.1.d: "According to our long tradition, we choose a Opolchenie Chancellor every month. This glorious tradition of our ancestors is honoured not only in our country, but also in absolutely all countries of the Keka nation. \n\nAccording to the results of the recent elections, our long-time friend Otto Kerk, the founder of Novokekia, will become the Chancellor. There is only one thing: will he fulfil the will of the people in times of need, or will he do the bidding of his foreign masters from Kekland?"
 opolchenie.5.t: "The decree of our Emperor."
 opolchenie.5.d: "Opolchenie Armed Forces report: on the borders with the Autonomous Republic of Opolchenie, the Opolchenie Army has encountered resistance from separatist armed formations. Our army is waiting for further orders from the Supreme Commander Edward Kekinescu."

 keklandia.3.d: "There is no more doubt: the Opolchenie wants to annex DRO! The Opolchenie army has been ordered to attack their military formations and break through to Kekziland. Technically, the Opolchenie has attacked DRO and is going to take it over. We can't let that happen!"

 opolchenie.7.d: "Unfortunately, the army failed to break the resistance of the people of the Democratic Republic of Opolchenie. The separatists repelled our attacks, forcing the Opolchenie army to retreat and entrench themselves. A black day for our whole country..."

 news.3.t: "Collapse of the Kekan Union."
 news.3.d: "The fires of the Opolchenie crisis have not yet been extinguished, but suddenly a new one is brewing: Repia is leaving the Kekan Union. With this, this interstate association ceases to exist completely. It is worth recalling that the Opolchenie also left the Unia, having dissolved the commission overseeing the Unia's terms. The need to leave the Unia was explained by the Repian authorities' disregard for the terms of the Unia by the government of Kekland, which launched a war with the Opolchenie without notifying Nenstva. Following the Opolchenie, Repia similarly dissolved the Unia Commission... \nThe President of Keklandia, Fisting Boy Nextdorovic, has already spoken out about the situation, calling the Repia officials liars and traitors to Unia. He also stated that the terms were misrepresented and Postrebornia should belong to Keklandia."

 news.3.f: "That's all."
 news.3.e: "It's Keklandia's fault..."
 keklandia.2.t: "Repia is leaving the union."
 keklandia.2.d: "Today the government of Repia officially announced that it is leaving the union called the Kekan Union. The government representatives reasoned their action on the grounds that Keklandia had violated the terms of the Unia by not notifying one of its members of a conflict with the Opolchenie. They also said that Postrebornia, according to the terms, remains with Repia. \n\nIt was revealed that the leader of Repia had signed a decree dissolving the commission to verify the terms of the Kekan Union. In fact, the Union has collapsed, as there is only one member: us."
 keklandia.2.a: "What are they doing?"
