 opolchenie.1.a: "Otto Kerk is a worthy candidate for the position"
 opolchenie.3.t: "The Emperor's speech"
 opolchenie.3.d: "Due to the tense situation in the Democratic Militia Opolchenie Emperor Kekron made a special speech in Kekingrad to address the people and journalists. \n\nAddressing the crowd and beginning his speech, the Emperor told reporters that he was extremely unhappy with the deadly protests in Kekziland. According to His Majesty, he has reason to believe that the current government is secretly fuelling tensions among the people, which in turn favours their Gardernian masters, as they do not want to see the Opolchenie united. \n\nThere have also been statements that the Emperor will soon issue a decree to bring troops into the Autonomous Republic to restore order, as well as to help the GCOS organisation, which is fighting Gardernian influence in the country. The Emperor has very high hopes that the conflict will end peacefully and the people will reunite again in spite of the enemy."
 opolchenie.3.a: "Should the Emperor make such decisions?"
 news.2.t: "DRO declares independence."
 news.2.d: "Disturbing news comes from the Opolchenie: Emperor Kekron I has issued a decree to bring a militia regular army into the Autonomous Republic of the Opolchenie to restore order. \n\nIn Kekziland, this news is seen as a takeover of the Republic, and therefore a violation of the agreements made after the civil war. Correspondents report the deployment of military forces in Kekziland, and the ARO authorities report the country's declaration of independence. At this point, the first skirmishes are reported on the border of the now independent Republic. News comes from Kekan City that Kekland is supporting the DRO in its conflict with the Opolchenie and is sending its forces to overthrow the government. World experts believe that the Opolchenie Emperor has decided to expand the borders of his state at the expense of the DRO. Perhaps the Opolchenie precedent will be fatal for an entity like the Kekan Union."

 opolchenie.4.d: "On this day again, radicalised crowds of people took to the streets of Kekingrad. Throughout the march, the radicals chanted roughly the same thing: "Down with the DPRO! \nBy the evening, the march became destructive: a mass brawl took place in the main square of the city. According to preliminary data, the most affected were supporters of the independence of the DRO, who decided to come out and express their disagreement with the opinion of the aggressive crowd, for which they were legitimately beaten by the radicals. The DRO embassy demands immediate clarification of the event."
 opolchenie.4.a: "Such marches will not end well for our country..."
 arepublicopolchenia.3.t: "Nationalist meetings"
 arepublicopolchenia.3.d: "Citizens dissatisfied with the events in Kekingrad began to take to the streets of cities. The inhabitants of Kekziland were particularly active. Gathering in front of the square, the discontented moved towards the government building. The crowd, fuelled by nationalists, reached the Government of the Republic building and began chanting slogans about expelling Opolchenie officials from the country. Meanwhile, on the outskirts of the city, Republican nationalists began to riot. \nA couple of hours later, it became known that the nationalists pogromed the house of one of the Opolchenie officials. The crowd trampled him to death right outside his residence. After this news, the crowds of protesters began to row. Night fell, but the whole country knew that the people of the Democratic Republic of the Opolchenie would not be satisfied with the death of one official alone...."
 arepublicopolchenia.3.a: "How destructive is the anger of the Kekan people..."
 arepublicopolchenia.2.t: "Opolchenie people beat up Kekziland tourists"
 arepublicopolchenia.2.d: "Today, terrible news came from the Opolchenie capital: nationalists held processions throughout the city with slogans about the expulsion of our party representatives and embassy. In addition, the procession took a destructive character throughout Kekingrad: nationalists descended on tourists from our Republic. According to unofficial reports, about a hundred Kekans who identified themselves as residents of the Democratic Republic were injured. Also as a result of the massacre, about 20 Kekans from the Republic were trampled or died in hospital. Our Embassy fears that they may be the next target of the Opolchenie radicals."

 arepublicopolchenia.1.d: "From every crevice of the media is broadcasting: the Opolchenie Emperor in Kekingrad has issued a decree on the introduction of troops into the Autonomous Republic of Opolchenie, which means that the militias have decided to annex us. According to intelligence reports, the  army has accepted the Emperor's decree and has begun moving towards our border. \n\nIt seems that the Emperor of the Opolchenie has dared to break the agreements made after the Opolchenie civil war. If the Emperor allows himself to break the agreements, then who is to stop us from declaring independence and opposing His Majesty's decree?"
 arepublicopolchenia.1.a: "Deploy military forces immediately!"
 keklandia.1.a: "The Opolchenie Emperor is making a big mistake..."
 keklandia.1.d: "From every crevice of the media is broadcasting: the Opolchenie Emperor in Kekingrad has issued a Decree on the entry of troops into the Autonomous Republic of the Opolchenie. According to intelligence reports, the Opolchenie army has accepted the Emperor's Decree and has begun moving towards the border of the Autonomous Opolchenie Republic. \n\nThe Green House has had a mixed reaction to the conflict: the ministers have long had a grudge against the Opolchenie for their aggressive policies. In addition, there are credible reports that the Opolchenie has temporarily disbanded the Kekan Union Commission, which could indirectly be considered a violation of the terms of the Kekan Union, which means that we have the right to send troops into the Opolchenie Moreover, the Minister of Defence of the Opolchenie secretly arrested Otto Kerk, the founder of Novokekia, who has been given the position of Chancellor in their country. \n\nOur main ally in the form of Gardernia has agreed to help resolve the conflict, so we can take the risk of supporting the independence of a potentially new ally."
 keklandia.1.t: "Emperor Kekron's speech"
 opolchenie.2.t: "Otto Kerk's arrest"
 opolchenie.2.d: "Deep in the night, Chancellor Otto Kerk of the Opolchenie was in his country residence, reflecting on the Emperor's speech. He was outraged that the Emperor was allowing himself to decide matters of such magnitude independently of Parliament and the Chancellor. Besides, he was occupied with other very important thoughts: he was trying to work out what he should do in this critical situation. What is the right thing to do? \n\nAt that time, a black car pulled up in front of the residence. Out of it stepped a Kekan with the recognisable cap of the Minister of Defence of the Opolchenie. Without knocking on the door, the minister and a couple of uniformed kekans went inside. Finally, the stranger with the cap introduced himself as Opolchenie Defence Minister Edward Kekinescu. \n\n-"Mr Chancellor, you are accused of espionage. According to the criminal code, I am obliged to arrest you and detain you until the official decision of the court." \n\nThe men in police uniforms approached Otto Kerk. Soon they escorted him to a car and took him away to an unknown destination. Only the minister did not go with Otto Kerk. He stayed in the residence, where he waited for the arrival of the Emperor himself..."
 opolchenie.2.a: "Future traitors belong in prison"
 opolchenie.1.d: "According to our long-standing traditions, we elect the Chancellor of the Opolchenie every month. This glorious tradition of our ancestors is honoured not only in our country, but also in all countries of the Kek's nation. \n\nAccording to the results of the recent elections, our long-time friend Otto Kerk, the founder of Novokekia, will become the Chancellor. But only one thing: will he fulfil the will of the people in times of need or will he do the bidding of his foreign masters from Kekland?"

 news.3.d: "The fires of the Opolchenie Crisis had not yet died down, but suddenly a new one was brewing: Repia was leaving the Kekan Union. Thus, this interstate association ceases to exist completely. It is worth recalling that the Opolchenie also left the Unia, having dissolved the commission overseeing the Unia's terms. \nThe need to leave the Unia was explained by the Repian authorities' disregard for the terms of the Unia by the Kekland government, which launched a war with the Opolchenie without notifying the Nenes. Following the Opolchenie, Repia similarly dissolved the Unia Commission... \nThe President of Keklandia, Fisting Boy Nextdorovich, has already spoken out about the situation, calling the Repia officials liars and traitors to Unia. He also stated that the conditions were misrepresented and Postrebornia should belong to Keklandia."

 keklandia.2.t: "Repia is leaving the Unia"
 keklandia.2.d: "Today, the government of Repia officially announced that it was leaving the union called the Kekan Union. The government representatives argued that Keklandia had violated the terms of the Union by not notifying one of its members of the conflict with the Opolchenie. They also said that Postrebornia, according to the terms, remains with Repia. \n\nIt was revealed that the leader of Repia had signed a decree dissolving the commission to verify the terms of the Kekan Union. In fact, the Union has collapsed, as there is only one member: us."
 keklandia.2.a: "What are they doing?"
 news.4.t: "The fall of Edenia"
 news.4.d: "War correspondents from Gardernia report that Keklandian troops entered the capital of the power Gardernia today. Almost without a fight, the Kekan tanks rolled into the city square, where they were greeted enthusiastically by the Kekan diaspora. It is reported that many of Edenia's residents, especially those of Gardernian ethnicity, are fleeing the city to escape possible Kekan terror. Meanwhile, some localised fighting is still reported on the outskirts of the city. \nNow, until recent events, the Keklandian military forces, in conjunction with the Opolchenie military, last controlled Edenia in 2020, when the very famous invasion of Libertadoria took place. After the overthrow of ISD, no one was planning to invade Edenia again..."

First sources report that the Baltican soldiers have just entered the presidential palace. \nSuddenly, a significant number of residents remain extremely unhappy with the invasion of the Baltican forces. Some people are resolutely going underground, where they plan to carry out guerrilla activities. Moreover, the pro-government groups remaining in the city openly provoke the Baltic soldiers into conflict. It is not reported how the high command of the Baltic military forces reacted to all these events. \nIn any case, on the whole, the residents tolerated the seizure of Edenia by the Baltikans."

The capture of the capital took place in the course of the naval landing operation "Lion's Leap", which was supposed to involve a direct landing on the capital island. According to the Jojonian General Staff, the operation was successfully executed with the lowest possible casualties. \nThe primary sources report a gathering of Gardernian citizens in the main square of the city. There is reason to believe that the Jojonian army plans to deport Gardernians from the city, but according to the temporary commandant of the city, Gardernians are being gathered in the square for "census and enrolment in the peasant communities". Which of the above is true is unknown, but either way, this day will certainly become a bank holiday for the Jojonians."

 morshucivilwar.1.d: "Today the anarchists entered the capital of the imperialist government of Morshustan, capturing the headquarters of our common enemy. In the government building, Morshutler's henchmen signed the surrender... \nAfter learning of this, our generals refuse to continue further resistance. In the troops prevails the opinion that the anarchists are our allies and that it is pointless to fight against them. Many members of our government are of the same opinion and propose a collective decision to join the anarchists in return for a session in the government and parliament. \nWe should think about what to do. We do not know what the future of anarchist ideology promises us, nor do we know what the reaction of our communist allies will be..."

 morshucivilwar.2.t: "The capture of the capital"
 morshucivilwar.2.d: "Our troops reached the capital and took the Fuhrer's main lair, the government building. Unfortunately, Morschutler was killed before our troops reached the government. The Fuhrer's surviving accomplices have been taken prisoner, and now we demand their complete surrender on our terms. \nThe capital city was practically unharmed after the capture, so our council could henceforth meet there."

 morshucivilwar.3.t: "Communists propose reunification"
 morshucivilwar.3.d: "There is an offer from the Communists to end the civil war and reunite the nation. In return, they offer joint administration of the state, as well as guarantees of immunity. \nThis proposal was very opportune: on the side of the Communist Party of Morshustan can act the alliance of SSRMM, opposition to which in the current conditions is simply impossible. Our council is unanimously in favour of accepting the proposal and reuniting with the Communist Party."
 morshucivilwar.3.a: "Looks like the massacre is over."
 morshucivilwar.4.t: "Communists are going to attack"
 morshucivilwar.4.d: "Just recently we took the capital of Morshustan, which was brought to our attention by the Communist Party of the Soviet government, based in our colony of CSMO. Today, they are also announcing the continuation of the Communist revolution, the aim of which is to overthrow our anarchist council. Soon we will face a confrontation not only with Communist Morshustan, but with the entire SSRMM alliance, which is sure to side with the Morshuan Communists..."
 morshucivilwar.4.a: "Damn it!"
 morshucivilwar.5.t: "The revolutionaries joined the revisionists."
 morshucivilwar.5.d: "The news of the capture of the capital reached the Communist Party of Communist Morshustan, our ally in the war against dictatorial Morshustan. The people's deputies, as representatives of our will and the will of the proletarians and soldiers, collectively decided that the continued confrontation was pointless. They saw a way out of this situation in joining the anarchists, who had obviously bribed the deputies with attractive conditions. Without consulting us, the deputies made a deal with the devil and declared the end of the revolution in the territory of Morshustan, which then led to the dissolution of the government and military forces. \nWe could have announced the restoration of order in the South Camp territories with the involvement of our army, but that would have resulted in a military confrontation with Anarchist Morshustan, which in turn had already fallen into the sphere of influence of the Imperialists from Keklandia and Jojonia. Besides, restoring order would take a lot of our forces, while seslamist terrorists are raging in the south and in the Allied Republics. \nThere was nothing else we could do but leave the territory of the former Communist Morshustan. We were joined by some Morshuan soldiers who disagreed with their government's decision..."

 news.7.t: "The end of the civil war in Morshustan"
 news.7.d: "On this day, the Council of Anarchist Morshustan declared the end of the civil war in the territory of Morshustan. The civil war in this state had lasted about two weeks, during which time the conflict had involved, in addition to anarchists, communist rebels in the southern colonies, as well as nationalists. The military confrontation ended with the victory of the Anarchist Council, which was joined by the externally sponsored leaders of the Communist Morshustan. \nThe Anarchist Council announced the construction of "Anarchist Communism" in the territories of Morshustan. However, the Council has not presented any plan of action, which makes this statement very doubtful. According to experts, it is impossible to build communism in conditions of anarchy. Most experts state that hard times are still ahead for the people."
